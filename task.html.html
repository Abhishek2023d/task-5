    <p><h2>1.Ahilya Asthan</h2><img width="1000px" src="ahilya.jpg" alt="">
        <p>According to Ramayana, Rama and Lakshmana went to forest with Brahmarshi Vishvamitra to protect his yagna. On their way, they came across a deserted place. When Rama inquired about the place, Visvamitra related the story of Sati Ahalya, wife of Gautama Maharishi. The Maharishi used to do penance by staying here with his wife. One day when Gautama Rishi had gone out of the ashram, in his absence, Indra came in disguised as Gautama Rishi. Ahalya, without knowing the real identity of the person, succumbed to Indra's desire. Gautam Maharishi came to know this and cursed his wife to lie as a stone in this place. When she pleaded, the maharishi said, when Rama visits this place, you will return to your normal self. Visvamitra told Rama to go into the ashram. As soon as Rama's radiance brightened the place, Ahalya stood up with her own body and prayed to Rama. Ahalya being the wife of Maharishi, Rama and Lakshmana paid their obeisance to her.[3]

            Ahalya Sthan is the place where once the ashram of Maharishi Gautama stood. The temple, in its present structural form was built between 1662 and 1682 during the rule of Maharaja Chhatra Singh and Maharaja Rudra Singh. This is also the first Ram Janaki temple in India.[4] The temple is beautifully made with fine patterns and designs of art and ancient Indian architecture. Inside the shrine, there is a flat stone said to contain the foot prints of Sita, wife of Ram, as the main object of worship.[5]

        <img src="download.jpeg" alt="">
        <p><h4>The Darbhanga Raj, also known as Raj Darbhanga and the Khandwala dynasty, was a Maithil Brahmin dynasty and the rulers of territories, not all contiguous, that were part of the Mithila region, now divided between India and Nepal.[3]

            The rulers of Raj Darbhanga were Maithil Brahmins and their seat in the town of Darbhanga became the core of the Mithila region as the rulers were patrons of Maithil culture and the Maithili language.[4][5]
            
            At its peak, the dynasty encompassed over 4000 square miles and is described as the "largest and richest of the North Bihar zamindaris and one of the greatest zamindaris of British India".[6] Despite not being recognised as a princely state by the British, Raj Darbhanga was larger and held more magisterial powers then many princely states, particularly those in Western India.
        <br>
    <br>
    The Khandaval dynasty were Maithil Brahmins who came into prominence in the time of the Mughal emperor Akbar until the 1960s. The extent of their lands, which were not contiguous, varied over time, and by the British era, their area of ownership was smaller than the area that they were granted under earlier sanad arrangements. A particularly significant reduction occurred when the influence of the British Raj caused them to lose control of the territories that were in Nepal but, nonetheless, their holdings were considerable. One estimate suggests that when their rule came to an end, the territories comprised around 6,200 square kilometres (2,400 sq mi), with around 4500 villages.[2]
